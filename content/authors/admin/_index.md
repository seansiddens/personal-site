Hey üëã, I'm Sean. I recently graduated with my BSc in Computer Science from University of California, Santa Cruz. There, I worked as a student researcher in the Concurrency and Heterogenous Programming Lab led by [Tyler Sorensen](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~tsorensen/). Right now I'm applying for graduate school for 2024-2025.
